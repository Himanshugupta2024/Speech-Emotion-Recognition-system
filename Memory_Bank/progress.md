## Current Sprint

### Sprint Goals
1. Initialize development environment
2. Set up project structure
3. Create basic pipeline
4. Implement core modules

### In Progress
- Development environment setup
- Project structure creation
- Initial documentation
- CI/CD configuration

### Blocked
- Model training (waiting for GPU resources)
- Performance testing (pending environment setup)
- Integration testing (waiting for core modules)

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. Need to implement proper error handling
2. Require comprehensive logging system
3. Missing API documentation
4. Need performance optimization
5. Security audit pending

### Bugs
*No bugs reported yet - development not started*

### Performance Issues
*To be identified during implementation*

### Security Concerns
1. Need to implement:
   - Input validation
   - Data encryption
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
   - Security headers
